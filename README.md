# FocusMic

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | [Website](https://focusmic.yayalu.top/) | [Releases](https://github.com/lageev/FocusMic/releases/latest)

Lock your macOS input microphone from the menu bar.

FocusMic is a small open-source macOS utility that keeps the system default audio input on the microphone you choose. If macOS, a Bluetooth headset, a USB interface, or another app changes the default input, FocusMic can switch it back automatically.

## Install

Download the latest build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lageev/FocusMic/releases/latest), or install with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install --cask lageev/tap/focusmic
```

Runtime requirement: macOS 15.0 or later.

## Use

1. Open FocusMic.
2. Click the menu bar icon.
3. Choose the input device you want to keep.
4. Turn on **Guard input device**.

When the chosen device is online, FocusMic keeps it as the system default input. If the device disconnects, FocusMic waits and restores it when it comes back.

## Features

- Menu bar device picker and guard switch.
- Automatic restore when the default input changes.
- Optional input volume lock for the selected device.
- Optional live input level meter, calculated locally.
- Device details: transport type, sample rate, bit depth, channels, volume, and in-use state.
- Hot-plug support for USB, Bluetooth, built-in, and other Core Audio input devices.
- Recent activity log.
- Launch at login.
- Direct-download updates via Sparkle. App Store builds are updated by the App Store.

## Privacy

FocusMic runs locally on your Mac.

- It does not record, upload, or analyze audio.
- The level meter only reads local loudness in real time and stores nothing.
- There is no account, analytics, ads, tracking, or crash reporting.
- GitHub/Homebrew builds only use the network for Sparkle update checks.
- Preferences are stored locally in `UserDefaults`.
